## Description

### Introduction

Golden Treasures is slimmed-down and updated version of Xeno's reliquary for Minecraft 1.7.10. At the time, Reliquary was abandonant and was becoming more and more unstable as Forge continued to update. As a result of this, myself and other devs took it upon ourselves to recreate a slimmed down version of Reliquary for Obscurity.

Reliquary has since been fully ported by another developer called P3pp3rF1y. As a result of this, Golden Treasures is depracated in favour of using P3pp3rF1y's port. You can find that on [GitHub](https://github.com/P3pp3rF1y/Reliquary) or [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/reliquary-v1-3).

## Release Notes

Release Notes (or changelogs) for Golden Treasures are availabl under the [files tab](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/golden-treasures/files) on CurseForge.
